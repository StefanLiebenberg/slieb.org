   start of my career as a software developer. I managed to produce e virtual tour web-application for my
   school.</p>

<p>After leaving school, ( 2009 ) I was invited by a friend, to work as junior developer on philosophersnotes.com. A
   website based on the ruby on rails framework. I got to implement designs and sharped my skills in the css, html
   and JavaScript and I learned a little bit of linux on the side.</p>


<p>I worked as a waiter.</p>

<p>2010, joined bani in artspace44</p>

<p>In 2011, I joined radical company as a developer in cape town. We build http://mothercare.ie/ and elcrussia in
   magento.</p>
